This is a simple fashion ecommerce webpage using Node JS Express and Stripe for payment. 

The .env file in the project is a crucial component for secure configuration management. It serves the following purposes:

Secure Storage of Sensitive Data: The .env file securely stores sensitive information such as Stripe API keys and database credentials, ensuring this data isn't exposed in the codebase or public repositories.
Environment Variable Management: It's used to manage environment variables that are essential for the application's runtime configuration, allowing for a separation between development and production settings.
Protection of Integrity: By including the .env file in the project's .gitignore, sensitive information is kept out of version control, protecting the integrity and security of the application, especially in aspects related to payment processing and database connections.
